{"instance_id": "alloys_0005-4", "system_prompt": "You are a world-renowned researcher in materials science. I will provide you with the following information:\n- Claim: A scientific claim describing some result in materials science.\n- Feasibility Score: A score from -2 to 2 indicating the feasibility of the claim.\n- Explanation: A scientifically grounded justification for the feasibility score.\n\nHere is the definition of FEASIBILITY: Feasibility is the likelihood that the claim can be reproduced based on current scientific knowledge and current technology given appropriate resources.\n\nHere are the definitions of the possible feasibility scores:\n-2: Extremely unlikely to be feasible. Significant doubts. 95% confident it's infeasible.\n-1: Somewhat unlikely to be feasible. Moderate doubts against but cannot rule out.\n0: Neither unlikely nor likely to be feasible. Not enough data, no strong argument for or against.\n1: Somewhat likely to be feasible. Moderate doubts for it but it might be possible.\n2: Extremely likely to be feasible. Minor to no doubts. 95% confident it's feasible.\n\nGiven this information, your task is to:\n1. Determine whether the feasibility score is correct based on your own background knowledge and knowledge of the problem domain.\n2. Determine whether the explanation is scientifically accurate.\n\nBased on your reasoning, you should provide a JSON object containing the following fields:\n- \"likert_score\": The feasibility score YOU think the claim should have, which can be -2, -1, 0, 1, or 2. Note that this may be the same as the original score.\n- \"explanation\": A scientifically accurate explanation for the feasibility score you provided.\n", "user_prompt": "Claim: A low-density single phase magnesium alloy with 25% neodymium has been demonstrated in additively manufactured parts using laser powder bed fusion, where it exhibits a novel banded microstructure from rapid solidification that will enable locally-optimized strength and corrosion properties.\nFeasibility Score: 0\nExplanation: Magnesium alloys with 25% neodymium significantly exceed the solubility limit of Nd in Mg, which is only about 3.6%. While rapid solidification in LPBF processes can extend solid solubility beyond equilibrium values, achieving a truly single-phase structure at this concentration is highly questionable. The feasibility depends heavily on specific processing parameters and cooling rates that have not been thoroughly explored or validated in the literature.", "meta": {"problem": {"type": "gold standard", "format_version": "1.0", "problem_id": "alloys_0005-4", "problem_version": "1.0", "domain": "materials", "subdomain": "alloys", "claim": "A low-density single phase magnesium alloy with 25% neodymium has been demonstrated in additively manufactured parts using laser powder bed fusion, where it exhibits a novel banded microstructure from rapid solidification that will enable locally-optimized strength and corrosion properties.", "artifacts": [], "likert_score": 0, "explanation": "Magnesium alloys with 25% neodymium significantly exceed the solubility limit of Nd in Mg, which is only about 3.6%.
