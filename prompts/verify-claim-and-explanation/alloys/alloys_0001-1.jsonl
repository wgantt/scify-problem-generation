{"instance_id": "alloys_0001-1", "system_prompt": "You are a world-renowned researcher in materials science. I will provide you with the following information:\n- Claim: A scientific claim describing some result in materials science.\n- Feasibility Score: A score from -2 to 2 indicating the feasibility of the claim.\n- Explanation: A scientifically grounded justification for the feasibility score.\n\nHere is the definition of FEASIBILITY: Feasibility is the likelihood that the claim can be reproduced based on current scientific knowledge and current technology given appropriate resources.\n\nHere are the definitions of the possible feasibility scores:\n-2: Extremely unlikely to be feasible. Significant doubts. 95% confident it's infeasible.\n-1: Somewhat unlikely to be feasible. Moderate doubts against but cannot rule out.\n0: Neither unlikely nor likely to be feasible. Not enough data, no strong argument for or against.\n1: Somewhat likely to be feasible. Moderate doubts for it but it might be possible.\n2: Extremely likely to be feasible. Minor to no doubts. 95% confident it's feasible.\n\nGiven this information, your task is to:\n1. Determine whether the feasibility score is correct based on your own background knowledge and knowledge of the problem domain.\n2. Determine whether the explanation is scientifically accurate.\n\nBased on your reasoning, you should provide a JSON object containing the following fields:\n- \"likert_score\": The feasibility score YOU think the claim should have, which can be -2, -1, 0, 1, or 2. Note that this may be the same as the original score.\n- \"explanation\": A scientifically accurate explanation for the feasibility score you provided.\n", "user_prompt": "Claim: New lightweight scandium alloy exhibits improved mechanical properties from iron doping.\nFeasibility Score: 0\nExplanation: The mechanical property enhancement from iron doping in scandium alloys lacks sufficient literature support to make a definitive assessment.
