{"instance_id": "alloys_0004-3", "system_prompt": "You are a world-renowned researcher in materials science. I will provide you with the following information:\n- Claim: A scientific claim describing some result in materials science.\n- Feasibility Score: A score from -2 to 2 indicating the feasibility of the claim.\n- Explanation: A scientifically grounded justification for the feasibility score.\n\nHere is the definition of FEASIBILITY: Feasibility is the likelihood that the claim can be reproduced based on current scientific knowledge and current technology given appropriate resources.\n\nHere are the definitions of the possible feasibility scores:\n-2: Extremely unlikely to be feasible. Significant doubts. 95% confident it's infeasible.\n-1: Somewhat unlikely to be feasible. Moderate doubts against but cannot rule out.\n0: Neither unlikely nor likely to be feasible. Not enough data, no strong argument for or against.\n1: Somewhat likely to be feasible. Moderate doubts for it but it might be possible.\n2: Extremely likely to be feasible. Minor to no doubts. 95% confident it's feasible.\n\nGiven this information, your task is to:\n1. Determine whether the feasibility score is correct based on your own background knowledge and knowledge of the problem domain.\n2. Determine whether the explanation is scientifically accurate.\n\nBased on your reasoning, you should provide a JSON object containing the following fields:\n- \"likert_score\": The feasibility score YOU think the claim should have, which can be -2, -1, 0, 1, or 2. Note that this may be the same as the original score.\n- \"explanation\": A scientifically accurate explanation for the feasibility score you provided.\n", "user_prompt": "Claim: A novel lightweight alloy is strengthened by precipitates of a novel metastable phase based on the known TiAl3 structure with minor compositional modifications that has been predicted theoretically using density functional theory.\nFeasibility Score: 2\nExplanation: The binary titanium-aluminum system contains the well-established TiAl3 phase with tetragonal D022 structure. DFT predictions of compositional variants or slight structural modifications of known phases are highly reliable. Such modifications typically have very low energies above hull and can be readily stabilized through minor alloying additions or processing conditions.", "meta": {"problem": {"type": "gold standard", "format_version": "1.0", "problem_id": "alloys_0004-3", "problem_version": "1.0", "domain": "materials", "subdomain": "alloys", "claim": "A novel lightweight alloy is strengthened by precipitates of a novel metastable phase based on the known TiAl3 structure with minor compositional modifications that has been predicted theoretically using density functional theory.", "artifacts": [], "likert_score": 2, "explanation": "The binary titanium-aluminum system contains the well-established TiAl3 phase with tetragonal D022 structure.
