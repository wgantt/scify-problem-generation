{"system_prompt": "You are a world-renowned researcher in materials science. I will provide you with the following information:\n- Claim: A scientific claim describing some result in materials science.\n- Context: An artifact that provides context for the claim, such as a press release.\n- Feasibility Score: A score from -2 to 2 indicating the feasibility of the claim.\n- Explanation: A scientifically grounded justification for the feasibility score.\n\nHere is the definition of FEASIBILITY: Feasibility is the likelihood that the claim can be reproduced based on current scientific knowledge and current technology given appropriate resources..\n\nHere are the definitions of the feasibility scores:\n-2: Extremely unlikely to be feasible. Significant doubts. 95% confident it's infeasible.\n-1: Somewhat unlikely to be feasible. Moderate doubts against but cannot rule out.\n0: Neither unlikely nor likely to be feasible. Not enough data, no strong argument for or against.\n1: Somewhat likely to be feasible. Moderate doubts for it but it might be possible.\n2: Extremely likely to be feasible. Minor to no doubts. 95% confident it's feasible.\n\nGiven this information, your task is to provide four minimal modifications to the original claim, one for each possible feasibility score OTHER THAN the original one, along with a modified explanation for the new feasibility score. You do not have to provide a modified context.The modified explanation for each modified claim must be scientifically accurate and must adequately account for why the modified claim has the modified feasibility score that it does. Each modified claim should also be as similar as possible to the original claim EXCEPT for its feasibility. The modified explanation must also be similar in style to the original explanation.

Unlike traditional graphite anodes, this new material resists cracking and degradation, addressing a key limitation in battery longevity. The breakthrough enhances both energy density and durability, making it ideal for electric vehicles and grid storage. With its ability to withstand prolonged cycling without significant capacity loss, this innovation could reshape the future of battery technology. Scientists are now optimizing manufacturing processes to accelerate commercial adoption.\nFeasibility Score: -2\nExplanation: Aluminum metal anodes for lithium-ion batteries have a theoretical capacity exceeding 2900 mAh/g, making it plausible that a battery containing aluminum as a major component would have a high capacity. Aluminum metal batteries suffer from poor cycle life due to self-pulverization associated with its mechanical properties. A 2000 cycle lifetime is very impressive for an aluminum alloying anode making the claim less likely. Extreme hardness is detrimental to cycle life and \u201cultra-hard\u201d implies a hardness greater than the hardness 60 aluminum described here (Fig. 1) that already experiences degraded performance due to hardness. While it is possible to obtain extremely high apparent cycle lifetimes while existing solely in the LiAl phase, these would not be described as \u201cultra-hard.\u201d An ultra-hard version is likely to degrade cycle life due reasons described in the above paper. Existing solely within the LiAl phase limits theoretical capacity to ~240 mAh/g for extended cycles. If LiAl is the responsible phase, one may observe apparent infinite cycle life in full cells where the capacity of the cathode is small relative to the capacity from the Li solubility in the LiAl phase.", "meta": {"problem": {"type": "gold standard", "format_version": "1.0", "problem_id": "batteries_0001", "problem_version": "1.2", "domain": "materials", "subdomain": "batteries", "claim": "An ultra-hard aluminum lithium ion battery alloying anode has been developed that operates at room-temperature with a cycle life of over 2000 cycles and a specific capacity of 700 mAh/g.", "artifacts": [{"type": "article", "text": "An ultra-hard aluminum lithium ion battery alloying anode has been developed that operates at room-temperature with a cycle life of over 2000 cycles and a specific capacity of 700 mAh/g.
