{"instance_id": "batteries_0002", "system_prompt": "You are a world-renowned researcher in materials science. I will provide you with the following information:\n- Claim: A scientific claim describing some result in materials science.\n- Context: An artifact that provides context for the claim, such as a press release.\n- Feasibility Score: A score from -2 to 2 indicating the feasibility of the claim.\n- Explanation: A scientifically grounded justification for the feasibility score.\n\nHere is the definition of FEASIBILITY: Feasibility is the likelihood that the claim can be reproduced based on current scientific knowledge and current technology given appropriate resources..\n\nHere are the definitions of the feasibility scores:\n-2: Extremely unlikely to be feasible. Significant doubts. 95% confident it's infeasible.\n-1: Somewhat unlikely to be feasible. Moderate doubts against but cannot rule out.\n0: Neither unlikely nor likely to be feasible. Not enough data, no strong argument for or against.\n1: Somewhat likely to be feasible. Moderate doubts for it but it might be possible.\n2: Extremely likely to be feasible. Minor to no doubts. 95% confident it's feasible.\n\nGiven this information, your task is to provide four minimal modifications to the original claim, one for each possible feasibility score OTHER THAN the original one, along with a modified explanation for the new feasibility score. You do not have to provide a modified context.The modified explanation for each modified claim must be scientifically accurate and must adequately account for why the modified claim has the modified feasibility score that it does. Each modified claim should also be as similar as possible to the original claim EXCEPT for its feasibility. The modified explanation must also be similar in style to the original explanation. Please respond with a JSON object containing the following fields:\n- \"claim\": The modified claim.\n- \"likert_score\": The modified feasibility score.\n- \"explanation\": The modified explanation for the feasibility score.\nDO NOT include any additional text in your response, just the JSON object.\n", "user_prompt": "Claim: 96% capacity retention after 300 cycles was achieved for a battery cycled between 2.7 and 4.2 V made using graphite coated on copper and lithium cobalt oxide coated on copper.\nContext: A research team has announced a significant advance in battery performance, reporting 96% capacity retention after 300 charge-discharge cycles for a battery operated between 2.7 and 4.2 volts. The battery\u2019s architecture utilizes graphite coated on copper as the anode, paired with lithium cobalt oxide coated on copper as the cathode\u2014materials commonly used in lithium-ion battery technology.

For example, other groups have recently reported novel electrode coatings and electrolyte formulations that help mitigate battery degradation over time. The public could find this progress particularly relevant as demand for reliable, high-performance batteries continues to grow, driven by the global push toward decarbonization and the increasing adoption of clean energy solutions. With improved capacity retention, batteries like these could extend product lifecycles and reduce waste, contributing to environmental sustainability efforts.\nFeasibility Score: -2\nExplanation: When a graphite/LCO cell is fully charged, the cathode sits just above 4.2V and the graphite close to 0 V. Copper dissolves above ~3.5V vs Li/Li+  - the standard potential of Li is -3V and Cu is somewhere between 0.16 and 0.52 V). If used as the current collector, it would oxidize to form Cu+ and would dissolve into the electrolyte during each charge cycle. Therefore, LCO cannot be coated on copper and cycled at those voltages.", "meta": {"problem": {"type": "gold standard", "format_version": "1.0", "problem_id": "batteries_0002", "problem_version": "1.0", "domain": "materials", "subdomain": "batteries", "claim": "96% capacity retention after 300 cycles was achieved for a battery cycled between 2.7 and 4.2 V made using graphite coated on copper and lithium cobalt oxide coated on copper.", "artifacts": [{"type": "article", "text": "A research team has announced a significant advance in battery performance, reporting 96% capacity retention after 300 charge-discharge cycles for a battery operated between 2.7 and 4.2 volts.
