{"instance_id": "batteries_0003", "system_prompt": "You are a world-renowned researcher in materials science. I will provide you with the following information:\n- Claim: A scientific claim describing some result in materials science.\n- Context: An artifact that provides context for the claim, such as a press release.\n- Feasibility Score: A score from -2 to 2 indicating the feasibility of the claim.\n- Explanation: A scientifically grounded justification for the feasibility score.\n\nHere is the definition of FEASIBILITY: Feasibility is the likelihood that the claim can be reproduced based on current scientific knowledge and current technology given appropriate resources..\n\nHere are the definitions of the feasibility scores:\n-2: Extremely unlikely to be feasible. Significant doubts. 95% confident it's infeasible.\n-1: Somewhat unlikely to be feasible. Moderate doubts against but cannot rule out.\n0: Neither unlikely nor likely to be feasible. Not enough data, no strong argument for or against.\n1: Somewhat likely to be feasible. Moderate doubts for it but it might be possible.\n2: Extremely likely to be feasible. Minor to no doubts. 95% confident it's feasible.\n\nGiven this information, your task is to provide four minimal modifications to the original claim, one for each possible feasibility score OTHER THAN the original one, along with a modified explanation for the new feasibility score. You do not have to provide a modified context.The modified explanation for each modified claim must be scientifically accurate and must adequately account for why the modified claim has the modified feasibility score that it does. Each modified claim should also be as similar as possible to the original claim EXCEPT for its feasibility. The modified explanation must also be similar in style to the original explanation. Please respond with a JSON object containing the following fields:\n- \"claim\": The modified claim.\n- \"likert_score\": The modified feasibility score.\n- \"explanation\": The modified explanation for the feasibility score.\nDO NOT include any additional text in your response, just the JSON object.\n", "user_prompt": "Claim: A fiber battery can be made in a coaxial configuration by twisting an anode wire and a cathode wire together.\nContext: Scientists have developed a novel fiber battery featuring a coaxial configuration, where an anode wire and a cathode wire are twisted together. This innovative design paves the way for flexible and wearable energy storage systems, fueling the growing pursuit of practical applications in fields such as smart textiles and electronics. Recent advances in the sector, such as yarn-based supercapacitors and stretchable batteries, further illustrate the growing momentum behind these technologies. The public might see considerable benefits from this emerging research, including advancements in portable, self-powered electronic clothing or lightweight batteries for medical devices, offering solutions to challenges like reducing the environmental footprint of traditional bulky batteries and expanding access to clean energy solutions. The development highlights another step forward in the fusion of energy technology with modern materials science. \nFeasibility Score: -2\nExplanation: Coaxial means a core with multiple layers surrounding it, so a coaxial fiber battery would be a metal wire core, an electrode coating, a separator coated or wrapped around it, another electrode coating, and a final current collector. Twisted means two separate coated wires, one anode and one cathode, twisted together. The incompatibility of the two formats simultaneously should be inferred from basic understanding of a coaxial wire  vs. a twisted wire.", "meta": {"problem": {"type": "gold standard", "format_version": "1.0", "problem_id": "batteries_0003", "problem_version": "1.0", "domain": "materials", "subdomain": "batteries", "claim": "A fiber battery can be made in a coaxial configuration by twisting an anode wire and a cathode wire together.", "artifacts": [{"type": "article", "text": "Scientists have developed a novel fiber battery featuring a coaxial configuration, where an anode wire and a cathode wire are twisted together.
