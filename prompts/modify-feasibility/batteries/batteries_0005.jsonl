{"instance_id": "batteries_0005", "system_prompt": "You are a world-renowned researcher in materials science. I will provide you with the following information:\n- Claim: A scientific claim describing some result in materials science.\n- Context: An artifact that provides context for the claim, such as a press release.\n- Feasibility Score: A score from -2 to 2 indicating the feasibility of the claim.\n- Explanation: A scientifically grounded justification for the feasibility score.\n\nHere is the definition of FEASIBILITY: Feasibility is the likelihood that the claim can be reproduced based on current scientific knowledge and current technology given appropriate resources..\n\nHere are the definitions of the feasibility scores:\n-2: Extremely unlikely to be feasible. Significant doubts. 95% confident it's infeasible.\n-1: Somewhat unlikely to be feasible. Moderate doubts against but cannot rule out.\n0: Neither unlikely nor likely to be feasible. Not enough data, no strong argument for or against.\n1: Somewhat likely to be feasible. Moderate doubts for it but it might be possible.\n2: Extremely likely to be feasible. Minor to no doubts. 95% confident it's feasible.\n\nGiven this information, your task is to provide four minimal modifications to the original claim, one for each possible feasibility score OTHER THAN the original one, along with a modified explanation for the new feasibility score. You do not have to provide a modified context.The modified explanation for each modified claim must be scientifically accurate and must adequately account for why the modified claim has the modified feasibility score that it does. Each modified claim should also be as similar as possible to the original claim EXCEPT for its feasibility. The modified explanation must also be similar in style to the original explanation. Please respond with a JSON object containing the following fields:\n- \"claim\": The modified claim.\n- \"likert_score\": The modified feasibility score.\n- \"explanation\": The modified explanation for the feasibility score.\nDO NOT include any additional text in your response, just the JSON object.\n", "user_prompt": "Claim: A battery made with graphite, LiPF6 electrolyte, and LCO can perform 200 cycles with greater than 95% capacity retention in a glass capillary tube when trace amounts of water are present.\nContext: A recent breakthrough in battery technology has demonstrated that a lithium-ion battery made with a graphite anode, an  electrolyte containing LiPF6, and a lithium cobalt oxide (LCO) cathode can perform 200 cycles with greater than 95% capacity retention when housed in a glass capillary tube with trace amounts of water present. This advancement highlights the potential opportunity to decrease manufacturing costs by assembling batteries in ambient conditions, rather than in humidity-controlled dry rooms. The unique form factor of capillary-tube packaging would also enable batteries to be placed in thin, narrow spaces that a traditionally packaged battery would be unable to fit inside. \nFeasibility Score: -1\nExplanation: The residual water entering the tube will react with LiPF6 to produce HF. This will then etch the glass and produce more water. This causes a cyclic reaction that rapidly degrades the electrolyte.", "meta": {"problem": {"type": "gold standard", "format_version": "1.0", "problem_id": "batteries_0005", "problem_version": "1.0", "domain": "materials", "subdomain": "batteries", "claim": "A battery made with graphite, LiPF6 electrolyte, and LCO can perform 200 cycles with greater than 95% capacity retention in a glass capillary tube when trace amounts of water are present.", "artifacts": [{"type": "article", "text": "A recent breakthrough in battery technology has demonstrated that a lithium-ion battery made with a graphite anode, an  electrolyte containing LiPF6, and a lithium cobalt oxide (LCO) cathode can perform 200 cycles with greater than 95% capacity retention when housed in a glass capillary tube with trace amounts of water present.
