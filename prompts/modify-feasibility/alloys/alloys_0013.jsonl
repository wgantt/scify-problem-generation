I will provide you with the following information:\n- Claim: A scientific claim describing some result in materials science.\n- Context: An artifact that provides context for the claim, such as a press release.\n- Feasibility Score: A score from -2 to 2 indicating the feasibility of the claim.\n- Explanation: A scientifically grounded justification for the feasibility score.\n\nHere is the definition of FEASIBILITY: Feasibility is the likelihood that the claim can be reproduced based on current scientific knowledge and current technology given appropriate resources..\n\nHere are the definitions of the feasibility scores:\n-2: Extremely unlikely to be feasible. Significant doubts. 95% confident it's infeasible.\n-1: Somewhat unlikely to be feasible. Moderate doubts against but cannot rule out.\n0: Neither unlikely nor likely to be feasible. Not enough data, no strong argument for or against.\n1: Somewhat likely to be feasible. Moderate doubts for it but it might be possible.\n2: Extremely likely to be feasible. Minor to no doubts. 95% confident it's feasible.\n\nGiven this information, your task is to provide four minimal modifications to the original claim, one for each possible feasibility score OTHER THAN the original one, along with a modified explanation for the new feasibility score. You do not have to provide a modified context.The modified explanation for each modified claim must be scientifically accurate and must adequately account for why the modified claim has the modified feasibility score that it does. Each modified claim should also be as similar as possible to the original claim EXCEPT for its feasibility. The modified explanation must also be similar in style to the original explanation. Please respond with a JSON object containing the following fields:\n- \"claim\": The modified claim.\n- \"likert_score\": The modified feasibility score.\n- \"explanation\": The modified explanation for the feasibility score.\nDO NOT include any additional text in your response, just the JSON object.\n", "user_prompt": "Claim: A compositionally complex ternary alloy consisting of equal weight percentages of Mg, Al, and Li has been shown to reduce the weight of aircraft skins compared to conventional 7000 series aluminum alloys when cold rolled into sheets and then precipitation hardened resulting in AlLi precipitates that also pin grain boundaries to resist grain growth and creep at operating temperatures as high as 450C, allowing this new alloy to also function closer to the leading edges of supersonic aircraft wings and missile fins.\nContext: A ternary alloy composed of equal atomic percentages of magnesium (Mg), aluminum (Al), and lithium (Li) has demonstrated the potential to significantly reduce the weight of aircraft skins compared to conventional 7000 series aluminum alloys. When cold rolled into sheets and then subjected to precipitation hardening, the alloy forms AlLi precipitates, which pin grain boundaries to prevent grain growth and creep at operating temperatures as high as 450\u00b0C. This thermal stability enables the new material to be used closer to the leading edges of supersonic aircraft wings and missile fins, where high heat and stress are common.
