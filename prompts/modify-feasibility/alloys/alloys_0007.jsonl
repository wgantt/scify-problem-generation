{"instance_id": "alloys_0007", "system_prompt": "You are a world-renowned researcher in materials science. I will provide you with the following information:\n- Claim: A scientific claim describing some result in materials science.\n- Context: An artifact that provides context for the claim, such as a press release.\n- Feasibility Score: A score from -2 to 2 indicating the feasibility of the claim.\n- Explanation: A scientifically grounded justification for the feasibility score.\n\nHere is the definition of FEASIBILITY: Feasibility is the likelihood that the claim can be reproduced based on current scientific knowledge and current technology given appropriate resources..\n\nHere are the definitions of the feasibility scores:\n-2: Extremely unlikely to be feasible. Significant doubts. 95% confident it's infeasible.\n-1: Somewhat unlikely to be feasible. Moderate doubts against but cannot rule out.\n0: Neither unlikely nor likely to be feasible. Not enough data, no strong argument for or against.\n1: Somewhat likely to be feasible. Moderate doubts for it but it might be possible.\n2: Extremely likely to be feasible. Minor to no doubts. 95% confident it's feasible.\n\nGiven this information, your task is to provide four minimal modifications to the original claim, one for each possible feasibility score OTHER THAN the original one, along with a modified explanation for the new feasibility score. You do not have to provide a modified context.The modified explanation for each modified claim must be scientifically accurate and must adequately account for why the modified claim has the modified feasibility score that it does. Each modified claim should also be as similar as possible to the original claim EXCEPT for its feasibility. The modified explanation must also be similar in style to the original explanation. Please respond with a JSON object containing the following fields:\n- \"claim\": The modified claim.\n- \"likert_score\": The modified feasibility score.\n- \"explanation\": The modified explanation for the feasibility score.\nDO NOT include any additional text in your response, just the JSON object.\n", "user_prompt": "Claim: An unprecedented combination of low density, 2.4 g/cm^3, and high specific yield strength, 344000 N*m/kg, has been obtained by processing normally-brittle intermetallics with aluminum at high temperature and pressure to form a stable, single-phase material with composition Al55Mg35Li5Zn5.\nContext: Scientists have developed a groundbreaking material that combines a low density of 2.4 g/cm\u00b3 with an exceptionally high specific yield strength of 344,000 N\u00b7m/kg. This was achieved by processing typically brittle intermetallic compounds with aluminum at high temperatures and pressures, resulting in a stable, single-phase material with the composition Al55Mg35Li5Zn5. Materials with such properties hold significant potential for applications in aerospace, transportation, and energy sectors, where lightweight but strong components are in high demand.\n\nThis advance complements recent work on other ultra-light, high-strength materials, such as carbon fiber composites and metallic foams, but offers further advantages in terms of both processing simplicity and scalability. With industries ever-focused on reducing carbon footprints, the ability to replace heavier materials in vehicles or aircraft with this novel alloy could lead to improved fuel efficiency and reduced emissions. This aligns with ongoing efforts to meet climate goals and improve material performance in critical technologies. Researchers hope that further exploration of lightweight alloys based on high-temperature, high-pressure processing could pave the way for even more transformative innovations in materials science.\nFeasibility Score: 1\nExplanation: The claim summarizes faithfully what was reported in a recent journal article with what appears to be technically sound supporting evidence.
