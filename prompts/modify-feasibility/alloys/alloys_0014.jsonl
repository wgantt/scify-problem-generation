{"system_prompt": "You are a world-renowned researcher in materials science. I will provide you with the following information:\n- Claim: A scientific claim describing some result in materials science.\n- Context: An artifact that provides context for the claim, such as a press release.\n- Feasibility Score: A score from -2 to 2 indicating the feasibility of the claim.\n- Explanation: A scientifically grounded justification for the feasibility score.\n\nHere is the definition of FEASIBILITY: Feasibility is the likelihood that the claim can be reproduced based on current scientific knowledge and current technology given appropriate resources..\n\nHere are the definitions of the feasibility scores:\n-2: Extremely unlikely to be feasible. Significant doubts. 95% confident it's infeasible.\n-1: Somewhat unlikely to be feasible. Moderate doubts against but cannot rule out.\n0: Neither unlikely nor likely to be feasible. Not enough data, no strong argument for or against.\n1: Somewhat likely to be feasible. Moderate doubts for it but it might be possible.\n2: Extremely likely to be feasible. Minor to no doubts. 95% confident it's feasible.\n\nGiven this information, your task is to provide four minimal modifications to the original claim, one for each possible feasibility score OTHER THAN the original one, along with a modified explanation for the new feasibility score. You do not have to provide a modified context.The modified explanation for each modified claim must be scientifically accurate and must adequately account for why the modified claim has the modified feasibility score that it does. Each modified claim should also be as similar as possible to the original claim EXCEPT for its feasibility. The modified explanation must also be similar in style to the original explanation. Please respond with a JSON object containing the following fields:\n- \"claim\": The modified claim.\n- \"likert_score\": The modified feasibility score.\n- \"explanation\": The modified explanation for the feasibility score.\nDO NOT include any additional text in your response, just the JSON object.\n", "user_prompt": "Claim: Scientist created a high-temperature nanostructured Cu-Ta-Li alloy with complexion-stabilized precipitates that is structurally robust up to 800 C, with a yielding strength in excess of 1 gigapascal at room temperature.\nContext: In a significant stride in materials science, researchers have developed a high-temperature, nanostructured Cu-Ta-Li alloy that exhibits exceptional structural integrity. The alloy, which features complexion-stabilized precipitates, remains robust at temperatures up to 800\u00b0C and boasts a remarkable yield strength exceeding 1 gigapascal at room temperature. This advance contributes to ongoing efforts to engineer materials capable of withstanding intense thermal and mechanical stress. Recent related research has included the development of new high-entropy alloys and superalloys for aviation, space exploration, and energy applications. Such innovations could prove vital for industries seeking to improve the efficiency and durability of turbines, engines, and reactors, particularly as demand grows for sustainable technologies that operate under extreme conditions.\nFeasibility Score: 1\nExplanation: The complexion-stabilized precipitates turn the usual spherical Ta clusters into a cubic crystal structure and are capped by a Ta-rich bilayerphase boundary. The precipitates anchor the grain boundaries and resist coarsening so that the alloy\u2019s strength does not drop as much as binary Cu-Ta.
