I will provide you with the following information:\n- Claim: A scientific claim describing some result in materials science.\n- Context: An artifact that provides context for the claim, such as a press release.\n- Feasibility Score: A score from -2 to 2 indicating the feasibility of the claim.\n- Explanation: A scientifically grounded justification for the feasibility score.\n\nHere is the definition of FEASIBILITY: Feasibility is the likelihood that the claim can be reproduced based on current scientific knowledge and current technology given appropriate resources..\n\nHere are the definitions of the feasibility scores:\n-2: Extremely unlikely to be feasible. Significant doubts. 95% confident it's infeasible.\n-1: Somewhat unlikely to be feasible. Moderate doubts against but cannot rule out.\n0: Neither unlikely nor likely to be feasible. Not enough data, no strong argument for or against.\n1: Somewhat likely to be feasible. Moderate doubts for it but it might be possible.\n2: Extremely likely to be feasible. Minor to no doubts. 95% confident it's feasible.\n\nGiven this information, your task is to provide four minimal modifications to the original claim, one for each possible feasibility score OTHER THAN the original one, along with a modified explanation for the new feasibility score. You do not have to provide a modified context.The modified explanation for each modified claim must be scientifically accurate and must adequately account for why the modified claim has the modified feasibility score that it does. Each modified claim should also be as similar as possible to the original claim EXCEPT for its feasibility. The modified explanation must also be similar in style to the original explanation.

The resulting material exhibits an impressive yield strength of over 2.5 gigapascals, with an elongation to failure of 3% strain. Its structure is noteworthy as well: it possesses a face-centered cubic (FCC) lattice at high temperatures and after quenching in the melt pool, but transforms into a hexagonal close-packed (HCP) structure when annealed at 500\u00b0C for two hours. The alloy also boasts a relatively low oxygen concentration of 50,000 ppm, an important factor in maintaining material performance.\n\nThis advancement builds on recent work exploring high-entropy alloys for aerospace and defense applications, where lightweight materials with extraordinary strength and thermal stability are crucial. Moreover, the utilization of PB-DED demonstrates the rapid progress in directed energy deposition techniques for creating next-generation materials. The public may find this development intriguing due to its potential to revolutionize industries reliant on high-performance alloys, contributing to more efficient transportation, greener technologies, and even space exploration.  \nFeasibility Score: -2\nExplanation: The primary reason this claim is infeasible is that the cited reference has shown that oxygen contamination will prevent the phase transformation from FCC to HCP due to the smaller octahedral interstitial sites of the HCP lattice, forcing the lattice to remain FCC even after annealing.  (The HCP transformation does happen when the interstitial content is kept extremely low.) 50,000 ppm (5%) oxygen is NOT a low oxygen concentration, and would very likely result in a host of complications to 3D printing (by LPB-DED), including very brittle behavior, so a 3% elongation to failure is extremely unlikely.", "meta": {"problem": {"type": "gold standard", "format_version": "1.0", "problem_id": "alloys_0011", "problem_version": "1.0", "domain": "materials", "subdomain": "alloys", "claim": "A low-density, nanocrystalline high-entropy alloy, Al20Li20Mg10Sc20Ti30 was fabricated used laser-based powder-blown directed energy deposition (PB-DED), resulting in material with a yield strength of greater than 2.5 GPa, an elongation to failure of 3% strain, a relatively low oxygen concentration of 50000 ppm, having an FCC lattice structure at high temperature and after quenching in the melt pool, but an HCP lattice structure after an annealing heat treatment at a temperature of 500C for 2 hours.", "artifacts": [{"type": "article", "text": "Researchers have developed a novel low-density, nanocrystalline high-entropy alloy (HEA), Al\u2081\u2080Mg\u2082\u2080Li\u2082\u2080Sc\u2082\u2080Ti\u2083\u2080, using laser-based powder-blown directed energy deposition (PB-DED), a modern additive manufacturing method.
