{"system_prompt": "You are a world-renowned researcher in materials science. I will provide you with the following information:\n- Claim: A scientific claim describing some result in materials science.\n- Context: An artifact that provides context for the claim, such as a press release.\n- Feasibility Score: A score from -2 to 2 indicating the feasibility of the claim.\n- Explanation: A scientifically grounded justification for the feasibility score.\n\nHere is the definition of FEASIBILITY: Feasibility is the likelihood that the claim can be reproduced based on current scientific knowledge and current technology given appropriate resources..\n\nHere are the definitions of the feasibility scores:\n-2: Extremely unlikely to be feasible. Significant doubts. 95% confident it's infeasible.\n-1: Somewhat unlikely to be feasible. Moderate doubts against but cannot rule out.\n0: Neither unlikely nor likely to be feasible. Not enough data, no strong argument for or against.\n1: Somewhat likely to be feasible. Moderate doubts for it but it might be possible.\n2: Extremely likely to be feasible. Minor to no doubts. 95% confident it's feasible.\n\nGiven this information, your task is to provide four minimal modifications to the original claim, one for each possible feasibility score OTHER THAN the original one, along with a modified explanation for the new feasibility score. You do not have to provide a modified context.The modified explanation for each modified claim must be scientifically accurate and must adequately account for why the modified claim has the modified feasibility score that it does. Each modified claim should also be as similar as possible to the original claim EXCEPT for its feasibility. The modified explanation must also be similar in style to the original explanation. Please respond with a JSON object containing the following fields:\n- \"claim\": The modified claim.\n- \"likert_score\": The modified feasibility score.\n- \"explanation\": The modified explanation for the feasibility score.\nDO NOT include any additional text in your response, just the JSON object.\n", "user_prompt": "Claim: AlBeMet AM162 alloy has been made into a low temperature thruster nozzle and bell, by a combination of forging and machining, and has been hardened against the operating temperature of 700C at the nozzle and bell connection by alloying with tungsten to increase the melting point and pin the grain boundaries to prevent creep deformation.\nContext: In a significant materials science advancement, researchers have engineered a low-temperature thruster nozzle and bell from the AlBeMet AM162 alloy. This breakthrough was achieved through a combination of forging and machining techniques. To ensure durability under operating temperatures of up to 700\u00b0C at the nozzle and bell connection, the alloy was further hardened by alloying with tungsten. This process increases the melting point and stabilizes the material's internal structure by pinning the grain boundaries, thereby preventing creep deformation.\n\nThis development builds on recent advances in materials engineering aimed at improving thrusters for space exploration and satellite propulsion. Comparable progress in additive manufacturing of heat-resistant alloys and ceramic composites has also pushed the boundaries of what spacecraft materials can endure. The public may find this innovation intriguing, as it addresses the critical challenge of creating more efficient and durable propulsion systems\u2014key to enabling longer missions, reducing costs, and supporting the expanding role of commercial and scientific space endeavors.\nFeasibility Score: -2\nExplanation: AlBeMet AM162 has a beryllium matrix with a high fraction of aluminum, which has a melting point (including Al-Be eutectic point) well below 700C. Although W is a high melting point metal, small alloying additions would tend to decrease the melting point, and the solid solubility of a large atom like W in either Al or Be is essentially nil anyway, so unlikely to change the melting points of the Al and Be phases significantly.", "meta": {"problem": {"type": "gold standard", "format_version": "1.0", "problem_id": "alloys_0008", "problem_version": "1.0", "domain": "materials", "subdomain": "alloys", "claim": "AlBeMet AM162 alloy has been made into a low temperature thruster nozzle and bell, by a combination of forging and machining, and has been hardened against the operating temperature of 700C at the nozzle and bell connection by alloying with tungsten to increase the melting point and pin the grain boundaries to prevent creep deformation.", "artifacts": [{"type": "article", "text": "In a significant materials science advancement, researchers have engineered a low-temperature thruster nozzle and bell from the AlBeMet AM162 alloy.
