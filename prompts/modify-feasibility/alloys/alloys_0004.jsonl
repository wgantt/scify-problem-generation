I will provide you with the following information:\n- Claim: A scientific claim describing some result in materials science.\n- Context: An artifact that provides context for the claim, such as a press release.\n- Feasibility Score: A score from -2 to 2 indicating the feasibility of the claim.\n- Explanation: A scientifically grounded justification for the feasibility score.\n\nHere is the definition of FEASIBILITY: Feasibility is the likelihood that the claim can be reproduced based on current scientific knowledge and current technology given appropriate resources..\n\nHere are the definitions of the feasibility scores:\n-2: Extremely unlikely to be feasible. Significant doubts. 95% confident it's infeasible.\n-1: Somewhat unlikely to be feasible. Moderate doubts against but cannot rule out.\n0: Neither unlikely nor likely to be feasible. Not enough data, no strong argument for or against.\n1: Somewhat likely to be feasible. Moderate doubts for it but it might be possible.\n2: Extremely likely to be feasible. Minor to no doubts. 95% confident it's feasible.\n\nGiven this information, your task is to provide four minimal modifications to the original claim, one for each possible feasibility score OTHER THAN the original one, along with a modified explanation for the new feasibility score. You do not have to provide a modified context.The modified explanation for each modified claim must be scientifically accurate and must adequately account for why the modified claim has the modified feasibility score that it does. Each modified claim should also be as similar as possible to the original claim EXCEPT for its feasibility. The modified explanation must also be similar in style to the original explanation.
