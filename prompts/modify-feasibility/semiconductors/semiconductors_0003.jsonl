{"system_prompt": "You are a world-renowned researcher in materials science. I will provide you with the following information:\n- Claim: A scientific claim describing some result in materials science.\n- Context: An artifact that provides context for the claim, such as a press release.\n- Feasibility Score: A score from -2 to 2 indicating the feasibility of the claim.\n- Explanation: A scientifically grounded justification for the feasibility score.\n\nHere is the definition of FEASIBILITY: Feasibility is the likelihood that the claim can be reproduced based on current scientific knowledge and current technology given appropriate resources..\n\nHere are the definitions of the feasibility scores:\n-2: Extremely unlikely to be feasible. Significant doubts. 95% confident it's infeasible.\n-1: Somewhat unlikely to be feasible. Moderate doubts against but cannot rule out.\n0: Neither unlikely nor likely to be feasible. Not enough data, no strong argument for or against.\n1: Somewhat likely to be feasible. Moderate doubts for it but it might be possible.\n2: Extremely likely to be feasible. Minor to no doubts. 95% confident it's feasible.\n\nGiven this information, your task is to provide four minimal modifications to the original claim, one for each possible feasibility score OTHER THAN the original one, along with a modified explanation for the new feasibility score. You do not have to provide a modified context.The modified explanation for each modified claim must be scientifically accurate and must adequately account for why the modified claim has the modified feasibility score that it does. Each modified claim should also be as similar as possible to the original claim EXCEPT for its feasibility. The modified explanation must also be similar in style to the original explanation. Please respond with a JSON object containing the following fields:\n- \"claim\": The modified claim.\n- \"likert_score\": The modified feasibility score.\n- \"explanation\": The modified explanation for the feasibility score.\nDO NOT include any additional text in your response, just the JSON object.\n", "user_prompt": "Claim: A multi-junction photovoltaic device comprised of AlGaN/GaN layers with an inert, anti-reflective silicon capping layer was created that showed 20% efficiency conversion under ultraviolet illumination.\nContext: Researchers have developed a cutting-edge multi-junction photovoltaic device composed of AlGaN/GaN layers, capped with an inert, anti-reflective silicon layer.

Antireflective coatings can be used to reduce loss of energy from reflected light. Silicon has a low energy bandgap (1.1eV) which should absorb ultraviolet light, allowing no light to reach the photovoltaic device, rendering it useless for any practical energy conversion. Silicon nanoparticles as small as 3nm have been shown to absorb UV light and reemit in the wavelength range of 550-750nm, which is well below the energy needed to activate a GaN based photovoltaic (>3.4eV). Additionally, Si films show UV absorption in as few as 92nm of film thickness.", "meta": {"problem": {"type": "gold standard", "format_version": "1.0", "problem_id": "semiconductors_0003", "problem_version": "1.0", "domain": "materials", "subdomain": "semiconductors", "claim": "A multi-junction photovoltaic device comprised of AlGaN/GaN layers with an inert, anti-reflective silicon capping layer was created that showed 20% efficiency conversion under ultraviolet illumination.", "artifacts": [{"type": "article", "text": "Researchers have developed a cutting-edge multi-junction photovoltaic device composed of AlGaN/GaN layers, capped with an inert, anti-reflective silicon layer.
