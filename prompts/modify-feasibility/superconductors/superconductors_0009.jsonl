I will provide you with the following information:\n- Claim: A scientific claim describing some result in materials science.\n- Context: An artifact that provides context for the claim, such as a press release.\n- Feasibility Score: A score from -2 to 2 indicating the feasibility of the claim.\n- Explanation: A scientifically grounded justification for the feasibility score.\n\nHere is the definition of FEASIBILITY: Feasibility is the likelihood that the claim can be reproduced based on current scientific knowledge and current technology given appropriate resources..\n\nHere are the definitions of the feasibility scores:\n-2: Extremely unlikely to be feasible. Significant doubts. 95% confident it's infeasible.\n-1: Somewhat unlikely to be feasible. Moderate doubts against but cannot rule out.\n0: Neither unlikely nor likely to be feasible. Not enough data, no strong argument for or against.\n1: Somewhat likely to be feasible. Moderate doubts for it but it might be possible.\n2: Extremely likely to be feasible. Minor to no doubts. 95% confident it's feasible.\n\nGiven this information, your task is to provide four minimal modifications to the original claim, one for each possible feasibility score OTHER THAN the original one, along with a modified explanation for the new feasibility score. You do not have to provide a modified context.The modified explanation for each modified claim must be scientifically accurate and must adequately account for why the modified claim has the modified feasibility score that it does. Each modified claim should also be as similar as possible to the original claim EXCEPT for its feasibility. The modified explanation must also be similar in style to the original explanation.

This capped film was then sealed into a diamond anvil cell with a hydrogen donor material and pressurized to 95 GPa with NH3BH3. The sample was laser-heated using a 100 W ytterbium-doped fiber laser to above 1000 K.\nContext: In a notable new claim, researchers report creating a superconducting La4H23 film by sputtering a lanthanum film and capping it with a thin palladium layer to serve as an oxidation barrier and catalyze hydrogen diffusion. The capped sample was sealed into a diamond anvil cell with a hydrogen donor material, then pressurized to 95 GPa using NH3BH3, and finally heated above 1000 K with a 100 W ytterbium-doped fiber laser. This development builds on other recent breakthroughs in high-temperature superconductors\u2014like hydrogen-rich compounds under extreme pressures\u2014and could ultimately reshape how we generate, distribute, and store energy.

The process includes a plausible method of increasing the hydrogen content to the appropriate stoichiometry. The process exhibits some protection to undesired side-reactions and no clear side reactions can be identified. Lanthanum hydrides like LaH10 have been known to superconduct at high temperatures and pressures. This is moderatly feasible as it is similar to empiricial evidence and the process is plausible.", "meta": {"problem": {"type": "gold standard", "format_version": "1.0", "problem_id": "superconductors_0009", "problem_version": "1.0", "domain": "materials", "subdomain": "superconductors", "claim": "A superconducting La4H23 film was produced by sputtering a lanthanum film and capping with a thin Pd layer to act as an oxidation barrier and catalyze hydrogen diffusion into the La sample.
