Significant doubts. 95% confident it's infeasible.\n-1: Somewhat unlikely to be feasible. Moderate doubts against but cannot rule out.\n0: Neither unlikely nor likely to be feasible. Not enough data, no strong argument for or against.\n1: Somewhat likely to be feasible. Moderate doubts for it but it might be possible.\n2: Extremely likely to be feasible. Minor to no doubts. 95% confident it's feasible.\n\nGiven this information, your task is to provide four minimal modifications to the original claim, one for each possible feasibility score OTHER THAN the original one, along with a modified explanation for the new feasibility score. You do not have to provide a modified context.The modified explanation for each modified claim must be scientifically accurate and must adequately account for why the modified claim has the modified feasibility score that it does. Each modified claim should also be as similar as possible to the original claim EXCEPT for its feasibility. The modified explanation must also be similar in style to the original explanation.

To make these traces, Al is patterned using water between the final lithography lens and the novel photoresist on top of the Al. The water provides a lensing effect that improves the patterning resolution. The Al is then etched.\nContext: Scientists have unveiled a groundbreaking process for fabricating aluminum (Al) superconducting traces, leveraging a clever application of water to enhance precision during the lithography stage. Specifically, water is introduced between the final lithography lens and a novel photoresist applied atop the Al. This creates a lensing effect that improves patterning resolution before the Al is etched into superconducting traces. The innovative approach could enable the production of higher-quality superconducting circuits for quantum computing and other advanced technologies. This advance complements recent strides in superconducting materials research, such as the development of high-temperature superconducting components and improved deposition techniques for ultra-thin superconductors. The ability to achieve finer patterning resolution is crucial for scaling down quantum hardware while maintaining performance, making this technique of interest to industries pursuing compact, energy-efficient computing systems. Additionally, scientists suggest that the method's simplicity could lead to its adoption in broader manufacturing contexts, potentially reducing costs for superconducting components needed in cutting-edge technologies or even grid-energy systems.\nFeasibility Score: 2\nExplanation: Immersion lithography with water is a well-established process for improving resolution in semiconductor manufacturing. Al is a superconductor when cooled below its critical temperature. As described, there are no obvious chemical incompatibilities since the water is located on top of the photoresist and is not in contact with the Al trace. Although there is some remaining uncertainty regarding the compatibility of the photoresist with water, there is precedent for compatibility between a photoresist and water.", "meta": {"problem": {"type": "gold standard", "format_version": "1.0", "problem_id": "superconductors_0014", "problem_version": "1.0", "domain": "materials", "subdomain": "superconductors", "claim": "A new process to fabricating Al superconducting traces has been developed.
