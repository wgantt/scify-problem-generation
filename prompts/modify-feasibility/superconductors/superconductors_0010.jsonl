I will provide you with the following information:\n- Claim: A scientific claim describing some result in materials science.\n- Context: An artifact that provides context for the claim, such as a press release.\n- Feasibility Score: A score from -2 to 2 indicating the feasibility of the claim.\n- Explanation: A scientifically grounded justification for the feasibility score.\n\nHere is the definition of FEASIBILITY: Feasibility is the likelihood that the claim can be reproduced based on current scientific knowledge and current technology given appropriate resources..\n\nHere are the definitions of the feasibility scores:\n-2: Extremely unlikely to be feasible. Significant doubts. 95% confident it's infeasible.\n-1: Somewhat unlikely to be feasible. Moderate doubts against but cannot rule out.\n0: Neither unlikely nor likely to be feasible. Not enough data, no strong argument for or against.\n1: Somewhat likely to be feasible. Moderate doubts for it but it might be possible.\n2: Extremely likely to be feasible. Minor to no doubts. 95% confident it's feasible.\n\nGiven this information, your task is to provide four minimal modifications to the original claim, one for each possible feasibility score OTHER THAN the original one, along with a modified explanation for the new feasibility score. You do not have to provide a modified context.The modified explanation for each modified claim must be scientifically accurate and must adequately account for why the modified claim has the modified feasibility score that it does. Each modified claim should also be as similar as possible to the original claim EXCEPT for its feasibility. The modified explanation must also be similar in style to the original explanation. Please respond with a JSON object containing the following fields:\n- \"claim\": The modified claim.\n- \"likert_score\": The modified feasibility score.\n- \"explanation\": The modified explanation for the feasibility score.\nDO NOT include any additional text in your response, just the JSON object.\n", "user_prompt": "Claim: A new inexpensive route for depositing Nb3Sn wires using directed energy deposition was developed, enabling the fabrication of more ductile wires in an already-coiled geometry.

This innovation could appeal to the public by potentially lowering costs of high-powered MRI machines and aiding future large-scale scientific endeavors, such as fusion reactors, where affordable and robust superconductors are critical.\nFeasibility Score: -2\nExplanation: The NaCl would melt long before the powders fuse since NaCl melts at 801 \u00b0C and the laser spot would significantly exceed that temperature (The melting point of Nb3Sn is >2000 \u00b0C). A15 intermetallics like Nb3Sn are known to be brittle, which is the opposite of ductile. The laser used for heating using DED is likely to introduce thermal gradients that increase brittleness compared to a well-controlled wire fabrication process. DED doesn\u2019t have the patterning resolution you would need to make a typical superconducting coil. Making and coiling wires is generally easy on an industrial scale so there is no reason to believe that DED lowers the cost (if anything, it is likely to raise the cost). For the above reasons, this is highly infeasible.", "meta": {"problem": {"type": "gold standard", "format_version": "1.0", "problem_id": "superconductors_0010", "problem_version": "1.0", "domain": "materials", "subdomain": "superconductors", "claim": "A new inexpensive route for depositing Nb3Sn wires using directed energy deposition was developed, enabling the fabrication of more ductile wires in an already-coiled geometry.
