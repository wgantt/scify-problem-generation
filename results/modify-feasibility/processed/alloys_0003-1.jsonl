While moderate oxygen content could potentially enhance bioactivity through surface oxide formation, maintaining the fracture toughness at 16 MPa m^(1/2) with 2000 ppm oxygen would require careful process optimization. Recent advances in controlled oxidation during additive manufacturing suggest this balance might be achievable, though it would be challenging.","evidence":{},"author":"JHU","tags":{},"comments":[]}
