The Ellingham diagram shows aluminum has higher oxygen affinity than scandium, which could lead to preferential aluminum oxide formation on the surface. However, the compatibility between Sc₂O₃ and Al₂O₃ layers and their adherence properties remain uncertain. The formation of mixed oxides or disruption of the scandium's natural oxide layer could limit the protective effectiveness.","evidence":{},"author":"JHU","tags":{},"comments":[]}
