While gallium typically segregates to grain boundaries and reduces toughness, specific processing conditions, alloy compositions, or microstructural modifications might produce unexpected results. Without comprehensive experimental data on the specific system and processing parameters, definitive conclusions cannot be drawn.","evidence":{},"author":"JHU","tags":{},"comments":[]}
