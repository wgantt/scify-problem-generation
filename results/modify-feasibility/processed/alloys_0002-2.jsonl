However, gallium's tendency to segregate to grain boundaries and form brittle intermetallic phases would likely still compromise fracture toughness. The claim remains somewhat unlikely as the fundamental thermodynamic driving forces for embrittlement are difficult to overcome completely.","evidence":{},"author":"JHU","tags":{},"comments":[]}
