The solubility of Nd in Mg is about 3.6%, making this composition highly feasible. The rapid heating and cooling in LPBF processes can indeed produce novel microstructures, and banded structures from rapid solidification are well-documented phenomena that can enhance mechanical properties.","evidence":{},"author":"JHU","tags":{},"comments":[]}
