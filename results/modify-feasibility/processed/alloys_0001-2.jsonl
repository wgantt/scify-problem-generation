Scandium readily forms Sc₂O₃, and the thermodynamic stability differences between Sc₂O₃ and Cr₂O₃ may not provide the expected synergistic protection. Additionally, chromium additions could potentially disrupt the scandium oxide layer formation or create galvanic corrosion issues, though some protective benefit cannot be entirely ruled out.","evidence":{},"author":"JHU","tags":{},"comments":[]}
