Both scandium and yttrium are rare earth elements with similar chemical behavior and readily form stable, protective oxide scales (Sc₂O₃ and Y₂O₃). The similar atomic radii and electronic configurations suggest good solid solubility and potential for forming continuous, adherent mixed oxide layers. Yttrium's well-documented role in improving oxide scale adhesion in superalloys supports this approach.","evidence":{},"author":"JHU","tags":{},"comments":[]}
