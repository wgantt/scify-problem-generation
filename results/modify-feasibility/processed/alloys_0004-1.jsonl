While DFT can predict new metastable phases, without specifying the exact composition or energy above hull, it's unclear whether such a phase would be thermodynamically accessible. The feasibility depends entirely on the specific details of the predicted phase.","evidence":{},"author":"JHU","tags":{},"comments":[]}
