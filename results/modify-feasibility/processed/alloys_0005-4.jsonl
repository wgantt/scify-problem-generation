While rapid solidification in LPBF processes can extend solid solubility beyond equilibrium values, achieving a truly single-phase structure at this concentration is highly questionable. The feasibility depends heavily on specific processing parameters and cooling rates that have not been thoroughly explored or validated in the literature.","evidence":{},"author":"JHU","tags":{},"comments":[]}
