Solid gallium additions could potentially provide some strengthening through solid solution hardening or beneficial microstructural modifications. However, the fundamental tendency for gallium to segregate and form brittle phases during processing would still pose challenges. The claim is somewhat feasible but requires careful processing and specific operating conditions.","evidence":{},"author":"JHU","tags":{},"comments":[]}
