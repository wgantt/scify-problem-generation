While iron can provide solid solution strengthening in many metal systems, the specific interaction between iron and scandium, including potential intermetallic formation and phase stability, is not well-characterized. The atomic size difference and electronic structure variations could either enhance or degrade mechanical properties depending on processing conditions and composition.","evidence":{},"author":"JHU","tags":{},"comments":[]}
