Processing under controlled argon atmosphere with trace oxygen is standard practice in laser powder bed fusion of magnesium alloys. The low oxygen content of 100 ppm is readily achievable and would prevent oxide formation, allowing the material to maintain its inherent fracture toughness of 16 MPa m^(1/2) while optimizing mechanical properties.","evidence":{},"author":"JHU","tags":{},"comments":[]}
