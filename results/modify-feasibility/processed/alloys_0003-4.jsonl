While variable oxygen pressure could theoretically tailor degradation rates, the impact of 5000 ppm oxygen on fracture toughness is unclear. Without specific data on how such oxygen levels affect WE43 mechanical properties during laser powder bed fusion, the feasibility of maintaining 16 MPa m^(1/2) fracture toughness cannot be determined.","evidence":{},"author":"JHU","tags":{},"comments":[]}
