Even with the extreme non-equilibrium conditions in LPBF processes, such a high concentration would inevitably result in multiple intermetallic phases and potentially brittle behavior. The fundamental thermodynamic constraints make a single-phase structure at this composition essentially impossible to achieve.","evidence":{},"author":"JHU","tags":{},"comments":[]}
