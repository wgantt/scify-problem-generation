While 500 ppm oxygen is less extreme than higher concentrations, it still exceeds typical protective atmospheres and would likely form brittle oxide phases. The claim that this improves corrosion resistance while maintaining fracture toughness at 16 MPa m^(1/2) contradicts established knowledge that oxygen contamination in magnesium alloys typically degrades mechanical properties.","evidence":{},"author":"JHU","tags":{},"comments":[]}
