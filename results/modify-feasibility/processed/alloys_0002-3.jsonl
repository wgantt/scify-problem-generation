Aluminum additions to iron alloys can enhance fracture toughness through solid solution strengthening, formation of beneficial precipitates, and improved grain boundary cohesion. Aluminum also provides excellent corrosion resistance, making it highly suitable for offshore applications. This substitution eliminates the fundamental thermodynamic issues with gallium while maintaining the desired mechanical property improvements.","evidence":{},"author":"JHU","tags":{},"comments":[]}
