      "claim": "New lightweight scandium alloy exhibits improved oxidation resistance from chromium doping.",
      "likert_score": -1,
      "explanation": "While chromium is known for its oxidation resistance due to protective Cr₂O₃ scale formation, the effectiveness in scandium alloys is questionable. Scandium readily forms Sc₂O₃, and the thermodynamic stability differences between Sc₂O₃ and Cr₂O₃ may not provide the expected synergistic protection. Additionally, chromium additions could potentially disrupt the scandium oxide layer formation or create galvanic corrosion issues, though some protective benefit cannot be entirely ruled out."

      "claim": "New lightweight scandium alloy exhibits improved mechanical properties from iron doping.",
      "likert_score": 0,
      "explanation": "The mechanical property enhancement from iron doping in scandium alloys lacks sufficient literature support to make a definitive assessment. While iron can provide solid solution strengthening in many metal systems, the specific interaction between iron and scandium, including potential intermetallic formation and phase stability, is not well-characterized. The atomic size difference and electronic structure variations could either enhance or degrade mechanical properties depending on processing conditions and composition."

      "claim": "New lightweight scandium alloy exhibits improved oxidation resistance from aluminum doping.",
      "likert_score": 1,
      "explanation": "Aluminum addition could potentially improve oxidation resistance through protective Al₂O₃ scale formation. The Ellingham diagram shows aluminum has higher oxygen affinity than scandium, which could lead to preferential aluminum oxide formation on the surface. However, the compatibility between Sc₂O₃ and Al₂O₃ layers and their adherence properties remain uncertain. The formation of mixed oxides or disruption of the scandium's natural oxide layer could limit the protective effectiveness."

      "claim": "New lightweight scandium alloy exhibits improved oxidation resistance from yttrium doping.",
      "likert_score": 2,
      "explanation": "Yttrium doping shows high feasibility for improving oxidation resistance in scandium alloys. Both scandium and yttrium are rare earth elements with similar chemical behavior and readily form stable, protective oxide scales (Sc₂O₃ and Y₂O₃). The similar atomic radii and electronic configurations suggest good solid solubility and potential for forming continuous, adherent mixed oxide layers. Yttrium's well-documented role in improving oxide scale adhesion in superalloys supports this approach."

  "user_prompt": "Claim: New lightweight scandium alloy exhibits improved oxidation resistance from iron doping.\nContext: In a remarkable announcement, researchers claim that a new lightweight scandium alloy exhibits improved oxidation resistance from iron doping. They report that adding iron will make the resulting scandium alloy stronger. This discovery aligns with other recent advances in high-performance metals—such as improved magnesium-lithium alloys—that aim to enhance both strength and corrosion resistance for industrial applications. From aerospace to consumer electronics, such developments hold the potential to reduce manufacturing costs, improve energy efficiency, and offer greater durability in everyday products.\nFeasibility Score: -2\nExplanation: Iron is not an oxidation-resistant element. On the Ellingham diagram the Fe -> FeO line lies above many common alloying elements (Al, Cr, Ti), showing that iron oxidizes readily once a protective scale is breached. Adding a readily-oxidized element cannot provide an intrinsic barrier to oxygen. Scandium already oxidizes before iron. The Sc -> Sc₂O₃ line sits well below the Fe line, meaning scandium will preferentially form a stable oxide layer long before any iron could intervene.",
